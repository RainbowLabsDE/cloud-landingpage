At RainbowLabs, we understand that lighting is a critical component of any architectural or interior design project. That's why we offer consultation and design services to help architects and interior designers create stunning and functional lighting installations.

Our team of experienced lighting experts works closely with architects and interior designers to understand their vision and design requirements. We then create custom lighting solutions that complement the overall design and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the space.

Our consultation and design services include:

- Lighting design and planning: Our team works with architects and interior designers to create lighting plans that meet their specific needs and requirements.
- Product selection: We help architects and interior designers choose the right lighting products that are energy-efficient, long-lasting, and fit their design vision.
- Installation supervision: We work with contractors and electricians to ensure proper installation and functioning of the lighting system.
- Compliance with regulations: We ensure that all lighting installations comply with building codes and regulations.
